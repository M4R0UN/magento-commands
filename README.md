# Command Lookup and How-To Repository
This repository contains my personal notes on how to perform certain tasks and lookup files using commands. I use this repository to keep track of useful commands, scripts, and procedures that I've learned while working with various technologies.

### Contents
The repository is organized into directories based on the different technologies that I'm interested in. Each directory contains subdirectories for specific topics or applications, as well as notes and scripts related to those topics. The main technologies that I'm currently focusing on are:

* Linux command line (e.g., Bash, Zsh)
* Git and GitHub (e.g., branching, merging, rebasing)
* Docker (e.g., containers, images, networking)
* AWS (e.g., EC2, S3, IAM)

### Notes
The notes in this repository are intended to be a personal reference for myself, but I'm sharing them publicly in case they're useful to others. Please keep in mind that these notes are a work in progress, and I'm constantly updating them as I learn new things.

### Scripts
I've also included some useful scripts that I've created to automate tasks or perform common operations. These scripts can save time and reduce errors when working with certain technologies or applications.

### Contributing
If you find any errors or have any suggestions for improving the notes or scripts, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always looking for ways to improve my efficiency and knowledge, and I welcome any feedback or contributions.
